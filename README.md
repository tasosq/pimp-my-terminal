## Usage

1. Clone the repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/tasosq/pimp-my-terminal.git
```

2. Run the `download-dependencies.ps1` script through your existing terminal. This script installs Windows Terminal, PowerShell, Oh-my-posh & Terminal-Icons.

3. Next, open the newly installed Windows Terminal & run the `setup-shell-terminal.ps1` script.
   The script will prompt you to pick an oh-my-posh theme, after outputting all of them to the terminal for you to choose.

### That's it! You now have a much better looking terminal!
